# Stream/Threads Server
This is a Stream/Threads server creating project in C language


## Introduction :

In this project we were requested to create a fork and threaded server in c to support client connection. </br>

## How To Run:

- Clone the projet to a linux environment. </br>
- Open a terminal and navigate into the corresponding folder ``StreamServer``. </br>
- run the command ``make`` in the terminal in order to create the ThreadServer and the StreamServer. </br>
- in two seperate terminals write the following (in order to run the program) : </br>
- 1. ``./ThreadServer`` </br>
- 2. ``telnet 'Hostname' 3490`` </br>
- > if you wish to run the stream server, do the same just with the other server - ``./StreamServer`` </br>
